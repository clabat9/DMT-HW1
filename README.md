# Search Engine evaluations and Near Duplicates Detection

The proposed work is divided in two parts:

- the first part performs the building and the analysis of various (simulated) search engines via the most famous metrics (MRR,etc.)

- the second part implements a Near Duplicate Detection procedure for songs lyrics based on minhashing.

Detailed explanations are presented in the **report.pdf** and in the implementations scripts.
